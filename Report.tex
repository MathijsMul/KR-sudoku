\section*{Introduction}

The Sudoku game is defined by a set of rules that can be considered as constraints on the admissible set of number assignments in the grid. These constraints depend on the distribution of the set of available numbers over the spatial units that are identified. Traditionally, $n^2$ rows, columns and blocks are distinguished, each of  which contain a total of $n^2$ cells, where $n =3$ is most conventional. In this paper, we will focus on this standard Sudoku format, whose solution requires the numbers 1 to 9 to be placed once and only once in each row, column and block. 

Logically, the constraints governing the Sudoku game can be considered as a set of axioms, which allow for the inference from an initial assignment of given numbers to a completely filled out grid through a number of intermediate reasoning steps. Each configuration of numbers that follows from the given assignment in accordance with the rules of the game can thus be seen as a 'theorem' of the particular Sudoku. Continuing this logic is eventually supposed to culminate in a correct solution to the puzzle.  

We will take this logical approach on the traditional $n = 3$ Sudoku format, and investigate different possible encodings of the game constraints. After identifying the minimal set of constraints that are necessary and sufficient in characterising the game, we will identify several extensions and variations. Using a SAT solver we will then study how the different and extended encodings influence the computational effort that is needed to solve puzzles that have been indicated to be of the same (human) difficulty rate on an online database. 

Thus, what we will do is look at alternative Sudoku encodings that are logically implied by the minimal set of constraints, and that could thus be considered redundant from a purely syntactic point of view. In particular, we wish to look at techniques that human solvers use to address Sudoku puzzles, formalize such strategies and add them to the encoding to study how this influences the required computational effort. Logically, such strategies could also be considered superfluous, as they follow from the general axioms and thus provide no new information. An interest in the difference between the computaional and the logical impact of adding such redundancies is the main motivation for this research. 


\section*{Hypothesis}

We hypothesize that adding clauses to the encoding of the Sudoku game will speed up the computation that is carried out by a SAT engine to find a solution. Even though such propositions are implied by the minimal set of constraints characterising the game, so that they are logically redundant, we expect that including them in the propositional representation of the game will lead to computational speed-up. 

\section*{Method, metric and data set}

The notion of computational effort at stake in this project is identified as the number of decisions that have to be made by a SAT solver in order to complete a Sudoku puzzle. This is our metric of computational `hardness'. We use the deterministic zChaff SAT solver, as it functions very well and provides the statistics we need. 
% average runtime?
% consider alternative solvers? 

For our data we have used Sudokus of fixed human difficulty degree from the data base on the following website: www.thonky.com. 


\section*{Results}

There is a minimal CNF representation of the Sudoku game including the following clauses:
- existence of cell values
- uniqueness in rows
- uniqueness in columns
- uniqueness in blocks
- representation of given numbers

% GIVE FORMULAS

Can be extended with
- cell uniqueness
- row defined
- col defined
- block defined

- human strategies (?)

for each: show computational statistics 

\section*{Conclusion}








NOTES

basic rules: axioms, techniques as logical consequences, logically redundant but may ease computation
	look at possible variations in basic axioms of
encodings (human techniques, jellyfish, xwings, naked singles)
look at different difficulty degrees
possibly consider improper sudokus too?

Goal: investigate different CNF representations of the Sudoku game constraints and study how they influence the computational hardness of SAT solving games (measured in flips)

There is a minimal CNF representation of the Sudoku game including the following clauses:
- existence of cell values
- uniqueness in rows
- uniqueness in columns
- uniqueness in blocks
- representation of given numbers

However, in manually solving a Sudoku puzzle, humans do not exclusively rely on these bare rules, but use them to infer ‘theorems’ and strategies that make solving easier.  As a seemingly trivial example: cell values must not only exist, but also be unique, and existence constraints also apply to rows/columns/blocks.

Specifically: 
* consider minor extensions of minimal representation 
* consider particular methods employed by Sudoku players, represent them in CNF, add them to the Sudoku representation and investigate impact on computational effort. 

(2) Method, metric and dataset

We are considering computational effort, and will be using the required number of flips as a measure. (Required running time should follow form these data in a device-specific way.)

(3) Dataset

%http://www.thonky.com/sudoku/ and scrape as per
%http://www.thonky.com/sandbox/new-sudoku/ThonkySudokuJavascript.js?puzzle_id=&difficulty=&puzzle_id=

or
http://www.menneske.no/sudoku/
and extract from html, so better use the other one. 

(4) Solver

We will use the zChaff SAT solver, because it appears to be the best one that is currently available.
